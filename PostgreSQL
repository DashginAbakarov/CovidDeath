-- 1. After finding length and appropriate date type for our sql table we can build it as below: 

create table death ( 

iso_code varchar(8), 

continent varchar(13), 

country varchar (32), 

date_column date, 

population bigint, 

total_cases integer, 

new_cases integer, 

new_cases_smoothed numeric(9,3), 

total_deaths integer, 

new_deaths smallint, 

new_deaths_smoothed numeric(8,3), 

total_cases_per_million numeric(9,3), 

new_cases_per_million numeric(7,3), 

new_cases_smoothed_per_million numeric(7,3), 

total_deaths_per_million numeric(7,3), 

new_deaths_per_million numeric(6,3), 

new_deaths_smoothed_per_million numeric(4,2), 

reproduction_rate numeric(3,2), 

icu_patients smallint, 

icu_patients_per_million numeric(6,3), 

hosp_patients integer, 

hosp_patients_per_million numeric(7,3), 

weekly_icu_admissions numeric(7,3), 

weekly_icu_admissions_per_million numeric(6,3), 

weekly_hosp_admissions numeric(9,3), 

weekly_hosp_admissions_per_million numeric(7,3) 

) 

-- a) VARCHAR (varchar means variable character used to contain small to medium range of value, alternative can be TEXT datatype but used to contain large range of value)  

-- b) BIGINT and INTEGER and SMALLINT both used to keep integer value but BIGINT used for longer one 

-- c) NUMERIC is used to keep values that has decimal point for example 12.234  NUMERIC(5,3) 5 is overall length 3 is after decimal point 

-- link for reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html

-- 2. we import our csv 

-- NOTA BENNE do not forget to click on headers in options section before importing excel file

-- 3. to find death percentage: 

Select country, date_column, total_cases, total_deaths, 

(cast(TOTAL_DEATHS as float)/NULLIF(TOTAL_CASES,0))*100 as deathpercent from death 

) 

--When dividing two integers, the result can be zero in two situations: 

--a) If the numerator is less than the denominator, the result will be zero because integers don't include decimal parts. 
--To handle this, we cast the numerator to a float before division. 

--b) If the denominator is zero, it creates an issue. To handle this, we use the NULLIF function. 
--It checks if the denominator is zero and returns NULL if it is, preventing any calculation problems. 

--references are below:
--https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-avoid-division-by-zero-in-postgresql/
--https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26537140/division-of-integers-returns-0

-- 4. Our deathpercent column yielded double precision values, which hold up to 15 digits after the decimal point, compared to float's 7 digits.
--To round these values, we can either create a temporary table or use a SELECT IN WITH statement.

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select country, date_column, total_cases, total_deaths, 

(CAST(TOTAL_DEATHS as float)/NULLIF(TOTAL_CASES,0))*100 as deathpercent from death 

)  

select *, ROUND(CAST(deathpercent AS numeric),2) AS rounddeathper FROM deathper 

-- Nota bene: if we do not cast double precision to numeric before using round() function PostgreSQL will give following error : 
-- function round(double precision, integer) does not exist 

--reference: https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAApHDvpSkde30EU4bpEffJBW2f4VS_nLN0Tzf8QHcft56d1JLw%40mail.gmail.com

--5. looking at the death percentage for particular country such as United States 

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select country, date_column, total_cases, total_deaths, 

(cast(TOTAL_DEATHS as float)/NULLIF(TOTAL_CASES,0))*100 as deathpercent from death 

)  

select *, round(cast(deathpercent as numeric),2) as rounddeathper  

from deathper 

where country ilike '%states%' 

--like and ilike is doing exactly the same thing but 
--ilike is not sensitive if words contain different letters such as Upper of small

--reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.3/functions-matching.html#:~:text=The%20keyword%20ILIKE%20can%20be,and%20~~*%20corresponds%20to%20ILIKE%20.

--9.we calculate how many total_cases percentage amongst population 

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select country, population, date_column, total_cases, total_deaths, 

(cast(total_cases as float)/NULLIF(population,0))*100 as caseperpop from death 

)  

select *, round(cast(caseperpop as numeric),2) as roundcaseperpop 

from deathper 

where caseperpop is not null 

order by roundcaseperpop desc 

--We have done same procedure above and also we give condition where our caseperpop(case percentage of population)
--is not NULL value avoiding to scroll down till find result values 

--10.we can calculate total case per country  

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select country, population, max(total_cases) as totcasepercount,  

max(cast(total_cases as float)/NULLIF(population,0))*100 as caseperpop from death 

group by death.country, death.population 

)  

select *, round(cast(caseperpop as numeric),2) as roundcaseperpop 

from deathper 

where caseperpop is not null 

order by roundcaseperpop desc 

--11.  we can also look at how many people died per country to do so again  

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select country, population, max(total_deaths) as totdeathpercount,  

max(cast(total_deaths as float)/NULLIF(population,0))*100 as deathperpop from death 

group by death.country, death.population 

)  

select *, round(cast(deathperpop as numeric),2) as rounddeathperpop 

from deathper 

where deathperpop is not null 

order by rounddeathperpop desc 

--12. find death percentage of cases according to date_column 

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select date_column, sum(new_deaths) as newdeathpermonth,  

sum(new_cases) as newcasepermonth,  

sum(cast(new_deaths as float))/sum(NULLIF(new_cases,0))*100 as newdeathperpop  

from death 

where continent is not null 

group by date_column 

)  

select *, round(cast(newdeathperpop as numeric),2) as rounddeathperpop 

from deathper 

where newdeathperpop is not null 

order by 1 

--13. we can also count date according to month using DATE_TRUNC function. 
-- This function is very simple and powerful. Basically allow us to extract any interval from date value 

--reference: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-date-functions/postgresql-date_trunc/

with deathper 

as 

( 

Select date_trunc('month', date_column), sum(new_deaths) as newdeathpermonth,  

sum(new_cases) as newcasepermonth,  

sum(cast(new_deaths as float))/sum(NULLIF(new_cases,0))*100 as newdeathperpop  

from death 

where continent is not null 

group by date_trunc('month', date_column) 

)  

select *, round(cast(newdeathperpop as numeric),2) as rounddeathperpop 

from deathper 

where newdeathperpop is not null 

order by 1 

--14. we also import covidvaccination csv file from excel to postgresql as we did previously 

create table vaccin ( 

so_code varchar(8),  

continent varchar(13),  

country varchar (32),  

date_column date,  

new_tests integer, 

total_tests integer, 

total_tests_per_thousand numeric(7,3),

handwashing_facilities numeric(5,3), 

hospital_beds_per_thousand numeric(5,3), 

life_expectancy numeric(5,3), 

human_development_index numeric(4,3) 

) 

--we try to combine a few colmns from both tables using inner join  

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,   

d.population, v.new_vaccinations  

from death d 

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and   

d.date_column=v.date_column 

where d.continent is not null 

order by date_column 

--NOTA BENE: Be careful if you combine columns which are identical for both tables avoiding ambiguity, 
--we need to specify table names in front of each column
--(in our cases I have used abbrivations for both tables such as d instead of death and v instead of vaccin) 

-- references https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Technical-Tips-Tricks/Column-is-ambiguous-SQL-Error/ta-p/592669#:~:text=You%20may%20see%20an%20error,id%20will%20resolve%20the%20issue.

--15. we can sum new_vaccinations column  

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population, v.new_vaccinations, sum(v.new_vaccinations) as totvac   

from death d  

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and    

d.date_column=v.date_column  

where d.continent is not null  

group by d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population,v.new_vaccinations 

order by sum(v.new_vaccinations) 

 

--Hold on. Despite using the SUM formula, SQL did not sum the values in the new_vaccinations column.
--The main reason is that SQL did not know in which category it should sum the values.
--This means we have multiple columns, so we need to specify based on which column we should sum the values.

--Therefore we can some for example based on country using over with partition clause 

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population, v.new_vaccinations, sum(v.new_vaccinations)  

over(partition by d.country) as totvac  

from death d  

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and    

d.date_column=v.date_column  

where d.continent is not null  

group by d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population,v.new_vaccinations 

order by 2 

--The OVER function can determine how we would like to split rows. 
--The PARTITION BY clause in the OVER function helps us group them according to our wishes.
--We can also use ORDER BY in the OVER function to specify the ordering of our data.
--We can use three variations: 

-- a) OVER (PARTITION BY name_column ORDER BY name_column) 
-- b) OVER (PARTITION BY name_column)
-- c) OVER (ORDER BY name_column) according to our wishes

--reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html

--When we run our query, the PARTITION BY clause groups all the same countries together.
--However, the total vaccination value appears in front of each row for that country because
--PARTITION BY groups but does not merge them into one row, even if we use the SUM function.

--16. Now we can look at what will happen if we use ORDER BY clause together with PARTITION 

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population, v.new_vaccinations, sum(v.new_vaccinations)  

over (partition by d.country order by d.country, d.date_column) as runtotvac 

from death d  

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and    

d.date_column=v.date_column  

where d.continent is not null and d.country ilike '%albania' 

group by d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population,v.new_vaccinations 

order by runtotvac 

--When we run the query this time, the result will be the running total of vaccinations. 
--This is because we group by country and order by date. Each country has different dates, making them unique.

--17th. Now we can look at data how many people vaccinated

--to do so we will take running total vaccination
--and divided by population but as we explained before we need to to use SELECT IN WITH query.

with vacpeop 

as  

( 

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population, v.new_vaccinations, sum(v.new_vaccinations)  

over (partition by d.country order by d.country, d.date_column) as runtotvac  

from death d  

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and    

d.date_column=v.date_column  

where d.continent is not null and d.country ilike '%albania' 

group by d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population,v.new_vaccinations 

order by runtotvac 

) 

select *, cast (runtotvac as float)/nullif(population,0) *100 as totvacpeop 

from vacpeop 

-- 18th. we can do the same with TEMP TABLE

-- To do so; firstly, we create new TEMP table with the name of table1 

-- Secondly, we add columns with same name and same data type we used above: 

CREAT TEMP TABLE Table1 

( 

continent varchar (13), 

country varchar (32), 

date_column date, 

population bigint, 

new_vaccination numeric, 

runtotvac numeric 

) 

-- Thirdly we insert data into our TEMP table table1 using INSERT INTO query; 

 

INSERT INTO table1 

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population, v.new_vaccinations, sum(v.new_vaccinations)  

over (partition by d.country order by d.country, d.date_column) as runtotvac  

from death d  

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and    

d.date_column=v.date_column  

where d.continent is not null and d.country ilike '%albania' 

group by d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population,v.new_vaccinations 

order by runtotvac 

-- Fourthly, we can use same query to find how many people vaccinated; 

select *, cast (runtotvac as float)/nullif(population,0) *100 as totvacpeop  

from table1 

-- 19th. we can also create a view using “CREAT VIEW”  

create view newview as 

select d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population, v.new_vaccinations, sum(v.new_vaccinations)  

over(partition by d.country order by d.country, d.date_column) as runtotvac  

from death d  

inner join vaccin v on d.country=v.country and    

d.date_column=v.date_column  

where d.continent is not null and d.country ilike '%albania' 

group by d.continent, d.country, d.date_column,    

d.population,v.new_vaccinations 

order by runtotvac
