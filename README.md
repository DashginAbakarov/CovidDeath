COVID Death & Vaccination PostgreSQL Project

The idea is to take a COVID death and vaccination dataset, make some quick changes, and upload it to PostgreSQL to create useful queries. In the original project, MySQL was used, and due to some complexity, built-in software was preferred for uploading. However, I found my own way to add the data directly into PostgreSQL using queries by adjusting the CSV file accordingly.

In addition, I have provided a detailed explanation and created my own queries. I also added a few more ideas in Excel to facilitate the project flow. To understand it further, please check the "explanation of Excel part" and "PostgreSQL queries and their explanation" files in this repository. You will find a comprehensive explanation of this project.
